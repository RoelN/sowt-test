# Browsers tests for State of Web Type

This project is a set of automated tests to determine the level of support for type and typographic features in web browsers. It tests existing and upcoming features to the best of its ability. Each test tries to follow the written specifications as closely as possible.

The test result data is used to generate the support tables for the website "[State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com)".

## How to run

Open up `index.html` in a browser you want to test and the tests will run automatically.
